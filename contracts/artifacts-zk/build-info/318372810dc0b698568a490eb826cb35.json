Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n *\n * The initialization functions use a version number.

This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n *\n * [CAUTION]\n * ====\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n *\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker.

@dev Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access\n control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role\n members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some\n applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see\n {AccessControlEnumerable}.\n Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed\n in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by\n using `public constant` hash digests:\n ```solidity\n bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n ```\n Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a\n function call, use {hasRole}:\n ```solidity\n function foo() public {\n     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));\n     ...\n }\n ```\n Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and\n {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n {_setRoleAdmin}.\n WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure\n accounts that have been granted it.

@dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed\n behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n For example:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```solidity\n contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n     function initialize() initializer public {\n         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n     }\n }\n contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n     }\n }\n ```\n TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n [CAUTION]\n ====\n Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\n the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```\n /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n constructor() {\n     _disableInitializers();\n }\n ```\n

These should be exposed in the external API and be unique.

To restrict access to a function call, use {hasRole}: ```solidity function foo() public {     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));     ... } ``` Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}. By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using {_setRoleAdmin}. WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to grant and revoke this role.

Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized. For example: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```solidity contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {     function initialize() initializer public {         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");     } } contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");     } } ``` TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:

Alternatively, use the SlotDerivation library to derive the slot.     bytes32 internal constant _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT = 0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc;     function _getImplementation() internal view returns (address) {         return StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value;     }     function _setImplementation(address newImplementation) internal {         require(newImplementation.code.length > 0);         StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value = newImplementation;     } } ``` TIP: Consider using this library along with {SlotDerivation}.\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/StorageSlot.sol\":\"StorageSlot\"},\"evmVersion\":\"paris\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"details\":{\"constantOptimizer\":false,\"cse\":false,\"deduplicate\":false,\"inliner\":false,\"jumpdestRemover\":false,\"orderLiterals\":false,\"peephole\":false,\"simpleCounterForLoopUncheckedIncrement\":true,\"yul\":true,\"yulDetails\":{\"optimizerSteps\":\"dhfoDgvulfnTUtnIf[xa[r]EscLMcCTUtTOntnfDIulLculVcul [j]Tpeulxa[rul]xa[r]cLgvifCTUca[r]LSsTFOtfDnca[r]Iulc]jmul[jul] VcTOcul jmul:fDnTOcmu\",\"stackAllocation\":true}},\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/StorageSlot.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xcf74f855663ce2ae00ed8352666b7935f6cddea2932fdf2c3ecd30a9b1cd0e97\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://9f660b1f351b757dfe01438e59888f31f33ded3afcf5cb5b0d9bf9aa6f320a8b\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmarDJ5hZEgBtCmmrVzEZWjub9769eD686jmzb2XpSU1cM\"]}},\"version\":1}","solc_version":"0.8.24","solc_zkvm_edition":null,"zk_version":"1.4.1"},"evm":{"legacyAssembly":null,"assembly":"\t.text\n\t.file\t\"StorageSlot.sol:StorageSlot\"\n\t.globl\t__entry\n__entry:\n.func_begin0:\n\tand!\t1, r2, r1\n\tjump.eq\t@.BB0_2\n\tadd\t128, r0, r1\n\tst.1\t64, r1\n\tcontext.get_context_u128\tr1\n\tsub!\tr1, r0, r1\n\tjump.ne\t@.BB0_2\n\tadd\t32, r0, r1\n\tst.2\t256, r1\n\tst.2\t288, r0\n\tadd\t@CPI0_0[0], r0, r1\n\tret.ok.to_label\tr1, @DEFAULT_FAR_RETURN\n.BB0_2:\n\tadd\tr0, r0, r1\n\tret.revert.to_label\tr1, @DEFAULT_FAR_REVERT\n.func_end0:\n\n\t.note.GNU-stack\n\t.rodata\nCPI0_0:\n\t.cell 53919893334301279589334030174039261352344891250716429051063678533632\n","bytecode":{"object":"00000001012001900000000c0000613d0000008001000039000000400010043f0000000001000416000000000101004b0000000c0000c13d00000020010000390000010000100443000001200000044300000005010000410000000f0001042e000000000100001900000010000104300000000e000004320000000f0001042e00000010000104300000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000200000000000000000000000000000040000001000000000000000000f57ab9eb6c6eb37515f3413ad6e5cd8fb2da4d5662c4cbbf8e3566092814a514"},"methodIdentifiers":{}},"irOptimized":"/// @use-src 13:\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/StorageSlot.sol\"\nobject \"StorageSlot_1853\" {\n    code {\n        {\n            /// @src 13:1407:4181  \"library StorageSlot {...\"\n            let _1 := memoryguard(0x80)\n            mstore(64, _1)\n            if callvalue() { revert(0, 0) }\n            let _2 := datasize(\"StorageSlot_1853_deployed\")\n            codecopy(_1, dataoffset(\"StorageSlot_1853_deployed\"), _2)\n            setimmutable(_1, \"library_deploy_address\", address())\n            return(_1, _2)\n        }\n    }\n    /// @use-src 13:\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/StorageSlot.sol\"\n    object \"StorageSlot_1853_deployed\" {\n        code {\n            {\n                /// @src 13:1407:4181  \"library StorageSlot {...\"\n                revert(0, 0)\n            }\n        }\n        data \".metadata\" hex\"a2646970667358221220f1ec12735700156cac03b8afc4ee961448a87221bed34a24c5c040c09ce055c364736f6c63430008180033\"\n    }\n}\n","hash":"01000007a56482c34fd1cac9cc157a51f07f2cbc9b1f0756ddacce48c0760844","factoryDependencies":{}}},"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/IERC165.sol":{"IERC165":{"abi":[{"inputs":[{"internalType":"bytes4","name":"interfaceId","type":"bytes4"}],"name":"supportsInterface","outputs":[{"internalType":"bool","name":"","type":"bool"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"}],"metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.8.24+commit.e11b9ed9\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[{\"inputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"bytes4\",\"name\":\"interfaceId\",\"type\":\"bytes4\"}],\"name\":\"supportsInterface\",\"outputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"bool\",\"name\":\"\",\"type\":\"bool\"}],\"stateMutability\":\"view\",\"type\":\"function\"}],\"devdoc\":{\"details\":\"Interface of the ERC-165 standard, as defined in the https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165[ERC].
