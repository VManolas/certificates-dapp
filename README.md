## User Flows

### Authentication

zkCredentials implements **role-based authentication** with guided defaults for optimal security and user experience.

#### Role-Based Auth Methods

| User Type | Default Method | Available Methods | Rationale |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Admin** | Web3 Only | Web3 | Public accountability and transparency |
| **University** | Web3 Only | Web3 | Public institution + high transaction volume |
| **Student** | ZKP (Privacy) | ZKP, Web3 | Privacy for authentication after one-time setup |
| **Employer** | Web3 (Standard) | Web3, ZKP | Flexibility for different hiring contexts |

#### First-Time Users Flow

**For Students (Privacy-First):**
1. Connect Web3 wallet
2. System auto-detects student role (if certificate exists)
3. **Private Login (ZK)** shown by default
   - 🔐 One-time setup - wallet visible during registration
   - 🛡️ Private authentication - ZK proofs hide wallet during login
   - ⚙️ Setup takes ~30 seconds, then login forever privately
   - 💡 Pro Tip: Use a dedicated "registration wallet" for maximum privacy
4. Web3 fallback available if needed
5. Access student dashboard

**For Employers (Flexible):**
1. Connect Web3 wallet
2. **Standard Login (Web3)** shown by default
   - 🔑 Simple & Fast - no setup required
   - ⚡ Instant Access - login in seconds
3. Upgrade to ZKP for executive search/competitive hiring
4. Access verification dashboard

**For Universities:**
1. Connect Web3 wallet (required by admin)
2. **Standard Login (Web3)** only
   - Public accountability as educational institution
   - Cost-efficient for high-volume certificate issuance
3. Access institution dashboard

**For Admin:**
1. Connect Web3 wallet (predefined address)
2. **Standard Login (Web3)** only
   - Public accountability and transparency
   - Administrative oversight requires visibility
3. Access admin dashboard

> 📖 **See [DUAL-AUTH-SYSTEM.md](docs/DUAL-AUTH-SYSTEM.md) for detailed authentication guide**  
> 📖 **See [AUTH-WORKFLOWS-BY-USER-TYPE.md](docs/AUTH-WORKFLOWS-BY-USER-TYPE.md) for complete workflow definitions**

### For Educational Institutions

1. Choose authentication method
2. Connect wallet (if using Standard Login)
2. Register institution with name and email domain
3. Wait for admin approval
4. Issue certificates by uploading PDF and entering student wallet

### For Students/Employers

1. Upload certificate PDF
2. System generates SHA-256 hash
3. Hash is verified against blockchain
4. View certificate status (valid/invalid/revoked)

## Smart Contract Functions

### InstitutionRegistry

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `registerInstitution(name, emailDomain)` | Register new institution |
| `approveInstitution(wallet)` | Admin approves institution |
| `suspendInstitution(wallet)` | Suspend an institution |
| `canIssueCertificates(wallet)` | Check if institution can issue |

### CertificateRegistry

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `issueCertificate(hash, student, uri)` | Issue new certificate |
| `revokeCertificate(id, reason)` | Revoke a certificate |
| `isValidCertificate(hash)` | Verify certificate validity |
| `getCertificatesByStudent(wallet)` | Get student's certificates |

## Security

- **Role-Based Authentication** - ZK proofs for students, Web3 for institutions/admin
- **Zero-Knowledge Privacy Model**:
  - Setup Phase: Wallet visible during one-time commitment registration
  - Auth Phase: Login privately with ZK proofs (wallet hidden)
  - Usage Phase: User controls when to reveal wallet for specific actions
  - Best Practice: Use dedicated registration wallet for maximum privacy
- All contracts use OpenZeppelin's battle-tested libraries
- UUPS upgradeable pattern for contract upgrades
- AccessControl for role-based permissions
- ReentrancyGuard on state-changing functions
- Custom errors for gas-efficient reverts

> 📖 **See [DUAL-AUTH-SYSTEM.md](docs/DUAL-AUTH-SYSTEM.md) for security details**

### Privacy Best Practices

**For Maximum Privacy with ZK Authentication:**

1. **Use a Dedicated Registration Wallet**
   - Create a fresh wallet specifically for ZK registration
   - Don't use this wallet for any other transactions
   - After registration, only login using ZK proofs (wallet stays hidden)

2. **Understand the Privacy Model**
   ```
   Phase 1 - Registration (One-Time):
   ├─ Your wallet IS visible on-chain
   ├─ Commitment is registered publicly
   └─ This is a necessary step for cryptographic setup
   
   Phase 2 - Authentication (Every Login):
   ├─ Login using zero-knowledge proofs
   ├─ Your wallet is NOT revealed
   └─ Complete anonymity during authentication
   
   Phase 3 - Usage (Your Control):
   ├─ Choose when to reveal wallet
   ├─ Required for: receiving certificates, transactions
   └─ Optional for: viewing, verification
   ```

3. **Transaction Privacy Tips**
   - Use privacy-focused wallets for registration (e.g., fresh address)
   - Consider using a relayer service in the future (Phase 2)
   - Separate your "registration wallet" from your "usage wallet"

4. **What's Private vs. What's Public**
   
   **Private (Hidden):**
   - ✅ Login authentication (after setup)
   - ✅ Session management
   - ✅ Identity verification with ZK proofs
   - ✅ Your private keys (never leave browser)
   
   **Public (Visible):**
   - ⚠️ Registration transaction (commitment creation)
   - ⚠️ Wallet that registered the commitment
   - ⚠️ Any transactions you make after login (if you choose)

5. **Why This Model?**
   - One-time wallet exposure for cryptographic commitment is unavoidable in Phase 1
   - After setup, you gain **permanent private authentication**
   - Future enhancements (Phase 2) will add meta-transactions for truly anonymous registration
   - This is more private than standard Web3 auth (100% wallet exposure)

**Example Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Create fresh wallet for registration
New Wallet: 0xABC... (dedicated for registration only)

# 2. Register with ZK Auth (wallet visible)
On-chain: 0xABC... → registerCommitment(commitment123)
Result: Public can see 0xABC registered commitment123

# 3. Login privately (wallet hidden)
ZK Proof: "I know the secret behind commitment123"
Result: No one knows which wallet is logging in!

# 4. Use the system
Future actions: You choose when to reveal wallet
```

> 💡 **Coming in Phase 2**: Meta-transaction support for truly anonymous registration via relayers
